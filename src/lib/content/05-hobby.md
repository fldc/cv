## After Hours

### Training

I am a big fan of training and I try to do it as much as I can. I love to lift weights.

### Coding

I love to code and I am always looking for new projects to work on. I have a lot of fun with it and I am always looking for new challenges.

### Gaming

I'm intermittently gaming, but I love to play games.

### Electronics

One always needs to build something new.
